# Inconsistent Styling in Tailwind CSS due to Missing Responsive Design Prefixes

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS where missing responsive design prefixes lead to inconsistent styling across different screen sizes.

## Bug Description
The bug is related to the use of Tailwind CSS classes without responsive modifiers (e.g., `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`, etc.). This can cause unexpected styling issues because Tailwind doesn't automatically apply styles to different screen sizes without these prefixes.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Observe the styling inconsistencies across different screen sizes.

## Solution
The solution involves adding the appropriate responsive design prefixes to the Tailwind CSS classes to ensure consistent styling across all screen sizes.  See `bugSolution.js` for the corrected code.

## Additional Notes
This bug highlights the importance of understanding and utilizing responsive design prefixes in Tailwind CSS to maintain consistent styling across various screen sizes.
